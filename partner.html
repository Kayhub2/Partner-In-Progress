    <h2>MY PERSONAL STATEMENT</h2>
    <p>My name is <a href="./2 ASSIGN 2 IMAGE.jpg"><strong><em>KALU MBA</em></strong></a>. I am a passionate teacher who doesn't just impart knowledge to my students,<br> but I'm a character moulder. I am very excited seeing my students do well in and outside classroom.
    <p>I see myself as a father to my students. As a father would be happy to see his children do well,<br>I do all I can to ensure that my students perform well.<br>
       We study together, play together and explore the adventures of learning together. I believe in the <br>
       biblical philosophy of <strong>'spoiling the rod to spare the child'.</strong></p>
    <p>Therefore, I don't hesistate to discipline any erring student in order to put them in the right track.</p>
    <p>As an experienced teacher, I 
      <ul><strong>
            <li>WRITE LESSON NOTES,</li>
            <li>TEACH,</li>
            <li>CREATE,</li> 
            <li>RESEARCH & </li>
            <li>IMPROVISE.</li>
        </strong>
      </ul>
      <p>These are intended to help me deliver lessons effectively and efficiently.</p>
